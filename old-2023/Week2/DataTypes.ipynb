    "# Assignment\n",
    "Creating web pages, graphic design, or game layouts often involves scaling an existing images to the space it is supposed to occupy in the design. Here is a rough lineup of the steps we need to perform:\n",
    "1. Get the width and height of the current image (in pixels).\n",
    "1. Get the desired width of the scaled image (in pixels).\n",
    "1. Calculate the ratio the image needs to be scaled by (greater than 1 means expand, less than one means contract).\n",
    "\n",
    "We often need for the image to occupy a space with a specific \"aspect ratio\", the ratio between the width and height of the image. That means we may need to edit the image by cropping out pixels, or adding pixels. Here are the steps:\n",
    "1. From the scaling factor, we can calculate the height, in pixels, of the scaled image.\n",
    "1. From the aspect ratio we can calculate the desired height, in pixels, of the image.\n",
    "1. **Normally we would compare the actual to the desired number of pixels, but we have not covered comparisons yet...**\n",
    "1. For now, let's do two calculations\n",
    "   1. The number of pixels to add would be the required pixel height minus the scaled pixel height. If the number is less than zero we do not need to add pixels, so we want to report zero. The \"max\" function will let you do this.\n",
    "   1. The number of pixels to remove would be the scaled pixel height minus the required pixel height. If the number is less than zero we do not need to remove pixels, so we want to report zero. \n"
