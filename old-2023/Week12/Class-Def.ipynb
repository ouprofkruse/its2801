    "# Assignment\n",
    "Define a class called \"Service\" that stores the name and the speed of internet services as properties. The class needs to have a \"constructor\", \n",
    "a method with the same name as the class which stores these values when an object is created. The class needs a second method called \"Report\" that takes two\n",
    "strings as input, and prints a combination of these prompts and the name and speed of the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your script then needs to read the \"services.txt\" file line-by-line and create a Service object for each one. Once the file is read, loop over all\n",
    "created Service objects and call the Report method for each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifics:\n",
    "- Create the class\n",
    "    - The name and speed of the service are non-public properties of the class\n",
    "        - Name is a string\n",
    "        - Speed is a double\n",
    "    - The conctructor takes a single string argument which contains one line from the input file\n",
    "        - Use Split to separate the string\n",
    "        - Store the name\n",
    "        - Convert the speed to double and store it\n",
    "    - The Report method has two string arguments\n",
    "        - Print the 1st string, then the service name, then the 2nd string, then the speed, all separated by a space\n",
    "- Define an array\n",
    "    - Create an array of type Service; give it more elements than needed (lines in the file)\n",
    "- Read the file\n",
    "    - For each line create a new Service object\n",
    "    - Keep track of the number of objects you have created\n",
    "- Create the output\n",
    "    - Loop over all objects you created\n",
    "        - Option 1: loop from 0 to the last index you used\n",
    "        - Option 2: loop over all elements in the array, stop when an element has the value \"null\"\n",
    "    - Call the Report method for each object, using the two string arguments to produce user-friendly output\n",
    "## Sample Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Service DSL has a typical speed of 66 Mbps\n",
    "The Service Cable (slow) has a typical speed of 350 Mbps\n",
    "The Service Cable (typical) has a typical speed of 500 Mbps\n",
    "The Service Cable (fast) has a typical speed of 800 Mbps\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example \"The Service\" was my 1st argument to Report, and \"has a typical speed of\" was the 2nd. \n",
    "This is only an example, you can choose your own wording."
