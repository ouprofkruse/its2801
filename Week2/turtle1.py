# The code below retriebves the screen width and height and turns the
# turtle to point up.
# Add code to:
# 1.) draw a black rectangle 50 pixels inside the screen border
# 2.) draw a red triangle that is half the size of the first one, and
#     centered inside it.

# leave the next 3 lines as-is
import turtle
height = turtle.window_height()
width = turtle.window_width()

# you can delete the next line after your script is working
turtle.left(90)
# +++ Add your script here +++



# leave this line as-is
turtle.exitonclick()
